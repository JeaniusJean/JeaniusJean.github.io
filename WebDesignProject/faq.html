                                        Every flower has a meaning, so tell your story with flowers or add your own meaning by using a favorite flower,
                                        or one symbolic of a family tradition or memory.</li>

                                    <li>Use seasonal flowers. You will save money, harmonize with the outside environment and the flowers are likely to be fresher,
                                        local or even organic if you follow the season.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Change the water every 2 days. This minimizes bacteria growth in the water which clogs the stems and causes the flowers to die sooner.</li>

                                    <li>Add a couple of drops of bleach to water after changes, also helping to reduce bacteria.</li>

                                    <li>Place flowers in the coolest place in the house at night.
                                        This may be a non-freezing garage, a basement or lower level (don't forget to bring them out for the day).
                                        This can double the length of life of cut flowers.</li>

                                    <li>Remove expired blooms or stems each day. Dead stems are more likely to decay in the water and the overall look of the flowers will be improved.</li>

                                    <li>Display flowers away from heat sources: heating vents, stoves, direct sun, large appliances or fireplaces.</li>

                                    <li>Give flowers at unexpected times. Valentine's Day is great,
                                        but giving flowers out of the blue is sure to surprise and delight a loved one
                                        and give them an even deeper feeling of attention since there is no prescribed reason.</li>

                                    <li>Ask your wife (girlfriend, daughter, friend) about their favorite flowers and colors,
                                        and write them down so you don't forget -
                                        You can also ask your florist to take notes about favorite arrangements for your loved ones.</li>

                                    <li>To find a great florist out of town, call the concierge desk of the nicest hotel and ask for their recommendation.
                                        When sending flowers out of state, do not call a 1-800 number or ask your local shop to place the order for you -
                                        you will pay up to 15% or more in extra fees! Instead, call the florist yourself. It takes a few more minutes,
                                        but you will get more for your money and better flowers. If you need a referral you can ask your local florist or call the best hotel in town.</li>

                                    <li>Take advantage of your florist’s same day delivery service.
                                        Same day delivery is usually available if you call in the morning,
                                        and it is one of the most convenient ways to show your gratitude and appreciation.</li>

                                    <li>Be specific, learn the names of flowers you want and ask for them. If you need some help getting to know names of some beautiful flowers,
                                        here is a list of some of our favorites to get you started: tulips and french tulips, calla lilies, oriental lilies, roses, orchids, lisianthus,
                                        bells of ireland, queen anne’s lace, hypericum berry,
                                        blooming branches such as cherry or quince, peonies, sunflowers, amaryllis, stars of bethlehem, sweet peas, dahlia, thistle, curly willow branch</li>

                                    <li>Flowers arranged in a vase will usually last longer than flowers arranged in a basket</li>

                                    <li>Give flowers to yourself!
                                        Flowers are an affordable luxury and a sweet gift from nature that will give you good feelings
                                        and a connection to life. Treat yourself well and you will be well.</li>

                                    <li>Place your orchid in bright indirect light, such as near a south facing window (but not right in the sill,
                                        unless you have a sheer (curtain), or in an east-facing window.</li>

                                    <li>Keep your orchid watered by placing one ice cube at the base every week.</li>

                                    <li>The orchid should never sit in a pool of water and it should dry out between waterings.</li>

                                    <li>Bright green leaves indicate good health. Dark green means means not enough light and reddish green means too much light.
                                        If leaves get blotchy or spotted this may also mean it has too much sun on it. Yellow leaves can mean too much water.</li>

                                    <li>If your orchid stops blooming for a long period this may mean it needs more light.
                                        After it has stopped blooming but still has healthy green leaves, cut the stem high,
                                        just above the "node" and below the lowest bloom. </li>

                                    <li>Have fresh flowers in your home. Flowers freshen and brighten both the room and the mood.
                                        Harvard studies shows that flowers make people more relaxed and compassionate toward others.</li>

                                    <li>Take nature walks. Children naturally feel surprise and admiration about nature.
                                        Give them and yourself time to stop in your tracks to observe natures wonders; the movement of ants or the scent of a rose.</li>

                                    <li>Send flowers to your children on special occasions, or just to say I love you.
                                        Having flowers delivered to your home is a great way to reward and celebrate your children.</li>

                                    <li>Transform a negative mood with nature. Going outside to play will often transform a young child's negativity.
                                        Drawing also can help. Making a simple, beautiful nature scene yourself can aid in your child's transformation.</li>

                                    <li>Gardening can be relaxing and therapeutic for parents as well as kids. Working in your home’s outdoor space is a self-care activity
                                        that you can do with your children, and can also be great exercise for all of you.
                                        There are many simple tasks even very young children can do to feel helpful and have fun such as digging, watering with a small can, or raking. </li>
